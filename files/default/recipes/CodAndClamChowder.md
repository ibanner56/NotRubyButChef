# Summary
**Time: For freaking ever, sorry.**  
**Feeds: A bunch of folks.**  
Took this up to Leavenworth this year. Turns out transporting soup in a dutch oven is a nightmare. Managed to get most of the soup up there, surrounding the pot with towels to keep it from spilling all over the back seat. The dutch oven did it's job keeping the soup warm, though, and it was a big hit with everyone who came along.  
I prepped the cod the night before and kept the pieces in the fridge overnight, but did everything else the day of. I started doing the rest of the prep work around 6am and took the soup on the road around 9...not a quick meal to fix up, for sure, but it was worth it.

# Ingredients
- 6 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1.5 lbs small Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
- 2 large leeks, white and pale-green parts only, finely chopped
- 4 sprigs thyme
- 2 lbs cod, skinned and cut into bite-sized pieces*
- 2 lbs littleneck clams, rinsed and cleaned
- 1/2 lbs scallops, rinsed, dried, and quartered
- 1.5 cups dry white wine
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2 cups water
- 2 tsp Better Than Boullion Fish Base
- 1 cup Bar Harbor bottled clam juice
- 2 cans Bar Harbor chopped clams, drained and rinsed (6.5 oz)
- Salt and pepper, to taste

# Directions
In a large saucepan, melt 4 Tbsp of butter over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes until garlic is fragrant but not burned. Add 1/2 cup of the wine and increase heat to medium-high until wine is brought to a simmering boil. Add clams and cooked covered for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until clams have opened. Drain the clams over a cheesecloth, saving the broth. There should be about 1 cup of broth afterwards - make up any difference with more of the fish base.

Heat oil and 2 Tbsp of butter in a large heavy pot (I use a dutch oven) over medium heat. Add potatoes, leeks, and thyme. Cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are tender. Add wine, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add cream, water, clam juice, and the broth from the clams and bring to a simmer. Stir in fish base and season with salt and pepper. Cook until potatoes are starting to fall apart, 50â€“60 minutes.  

Add cod and scallops to the pot and gently poach over a low simmer until the soup reaches the desired consistency. Remove the clam meats from their shells and add to the pot, along with the chopped clams. Serve with hot sauce or my personal favorite, Old Bay.

// TODO: The cod seemed to really thin the soup out when added. Try adding a blond roux to thicken the soup faster, or potentially just try patting down the fish ahead of time.  
// TODO: Try doubling the number of littleneck clams and opting out of the canned variety. This will likely require an increase in the butter and white wine.
