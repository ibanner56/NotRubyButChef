These are always a treat. Feel free to use fresh carrots for this recipe instead of frozen, but be sure to boil the slices of carrot for 5 minutes before adding them to the glaze.

# Ingredients
- 3/4 scotch whiskey
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 2 bags Kroger frozen crinkle-cut carrots

# Directions
Add the scotch to a large saucepan and reduce over medium heat until most of the alcohol has cooked off (smell it to test).  

Melt the butter in the scotch and stir in the maple syrup. Reduce the mixture over medium heat, stirring occaisionally.  

Add the carrots and stir to coat. Return the glaze to a simmer and continue to cook carrots until the glaze thickens.
