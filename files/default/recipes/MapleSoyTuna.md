This and the Garlic Sesame Green Beans were my go-to when I was living in Denver for a summer. Requires very little prep and the tuna cooks to perfection very quickly. I've made it with ginger root in the marinade before, but that's harder to keep on hand so I've since left that behind me.  
My sister once unfollowed me on Instagram because I kept posting photos of this, so be warned. Not sure what you should be warned about, but be warned all the same.

# Ingredients
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1 Tbsp Asian (toasted) sesame oil
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-2 tuna steaks, thawed

# Directions
Mix all the saucy bits together. Marinate the tuna steaks in a large ziplock bag or airtight container at room temperature for 20 minutes, or in the fridge for as long as you like.  

Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Remove steaks from marinade and arrange in the hot pan; gently shake pan to avoid sticking. Cook approximately 1 1/2 minutes and flip. Cook other side until tuna is desired doneness, 1 to 2 more minutes.  

// TODO: Try this with some mirin in the marinade. A mirinade, if you will.
