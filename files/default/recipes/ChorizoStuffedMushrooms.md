This one was super easy to put together and received a ton of compliments. I love mushrooms so I'm going to be holding on to this recipe for a very long time.  
On my first run through I picked up a nondescript block of Manchego from QFC and it went fine. Apparently those are usually 3 month Manchegos, according to the cheese guy at Whole Foods. He recommended I try making the stuffing with a 12 month Manchego, since those offer a bit more stability - hopefully things turn out even better this time.

# Ingredients
- 1 package El Burrito Soyrizo (12 oz) 
- 36 large (about 2 1/2 to 3-inch) white mushrooms
- 2/3 cup olive oil, plus 2-ish tablespoons
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 1.25 cups bread crumbs
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 tsp Better Than Boullion Vegetable Base
- 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley leaves
- 2/3 cup coarsely grated Manchego cheese

# Directions
Remove the stems from the mushrooms. Mince half the stems and eat the rest. Brush the mushroom caps with olive oil and set on a baking sheet. Set aside.  

Pour the remaining 2/3 cup olive oil into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and minced mushroom stems. Cook, stirring, until onions soften. Add the bread crumbs and toss and stir until toasted golden brown. Scrape the bread crumb mixture into a bowl and set aside.  

Wipe the skillet clean with paper towels and add the soyrizo. Leave on medium-high heat until cooked through. Fold in the bread crumb mixture. Add the chicken stock and parsley and fluff with a fork. Stir in the Manchego cheese.  

Use a spoon or your hands to fill the mushroom caps, mounding the stuffing attractively. Bake until the stuffing browns, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot or warm.
