# Summary
**Time: 3-5 hours**  
**Feeds: 8**  
This recipe is meant to sit and cook for a long while so the gravy can get just right and the meatballs can absorb some of the flavor.
I prefer to cook this recipe in a dutch oven, since it holds its heat so well and lets me use just one dish to cook the recipe.  

# Ingredients
- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 4 Tbsp flour
- 1 pint heavy cream
- 2 cups water
- 2 tsp Better Than Boullion Vegetable Base
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 2 bags Gardein Meatless Meatballs

# Directions
In a sauce pan or dutch oven, melt the butter and add the flour, stirring to form a paste. I like to let the roux cook until it's browned.*  

Once your roux is prepared, tansfer it to the dish you'll be using for the gravy and meatballs (if you used a dutch oven, there's no need to move anything). Add the heavy cream and the water and heat the mixture over med-high until it just starts to simmer.  

Add the vegetable base, mustard, and worcestershire sauce and stir until everything is properly mixed. Submerge the meatballs in the gravy and continue to heat the dish on med-high until the gravy returns to a simmer.  

Lower the heat and simmer the gravy, covered, for as long as you'd like, stirring occaisionally.  

If I want to increase the size of the recipe I add 2 Tbsp of butter and flour when preparing the roux, an extra 1 cup of both water and vegetable base, an extra 1/2 tsp of mustard and worcestershire sauce, and an additional bag of meatballs.
