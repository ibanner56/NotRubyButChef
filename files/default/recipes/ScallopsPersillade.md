# Summary
**Time: 15 minutes**  
**Serves: 2-3**  
Only made this once, but I was happy with the results. You want to aim for larger scallops if you can - bay scallops are way too small and some sea scallops are as well. Goes very well served atop a warm risotto.

# Ingredients
- Sea scallops (generally four or five per person)
- A splash of sweet white wine
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 5 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 4 tablespoons parsley, chopped

Rinse and blot scallops dry with paper towels. Warm olive oil over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, place scallops in pan in one layer. Allow scallops to brown on one side for 2 minutes, then turn and cook for 1 minute on other side. Remove scallops from the pan and set aside.  

Turn down heat slightly. Add white wine to deglaze* pan, then add butter in medium chunks and swirl to melt. Add garlic and let it cook a short while, for around 30 seconds, until it's just becoming fragrant.  

Return scallops to pan and gently heat through. Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons parsley and turn off heat.  

Plate immediately with a risotto or israeli couscous. Spoon sauce evenly over each serving.
