**Time: 30 min**  
**Serves: A whole bunch**  
This serves as a good dip for a party or similar event. Goes very well with pita chips.  
I used to call this "Vegetarian Chopped Liver", since that's the name the recipe I pulled this from used. Turns out nobody eats it if you call it that, so I call it what it is, basically. I've gotten a much better response after making the switch.

# Ingredients
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 5 baseball-sized onions, chopped
- 1 cup toasted walnuts
- 4 peeled hard boiled eggs, one set aside for garnish
- 1 can (15 oz) peas, drained
- Salt and pepper to taste

# Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread walnuts in a single layer on a foil-lined baking sheet. Roast for 5 to 10 minutes, and up to 12, tossing the nuts around occasionally to ensure even cooking. Nuts are done when they appear a shade darker and smell toasty.  

Heat up the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute the chopped onion over medium-low heat until it softens and caramelizes.  

In a food processor, combine sauteed onion, toasted walnuts, 3 hard boiled eggs, and peas, saving 1/2 cup of onion. Pulse to mix, then process until you reach a textured pasty consistency. Add salt to taste and continue to process until smooth. Mix in remaining onion and garnish with chopped egg.
