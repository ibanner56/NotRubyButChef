I just stole this off the back of the Jambalaya box and fiddled with some of the ingredients.

# Ingredients
- 2 packages Zatarain's Jambalaya Mix
- 1 package Tofurky Andoiulle fake sausage, sliced
- 1 package Gardein Teriyaki Chick'n Strips, cubed, sauce discarded
- 1 can (4 oz) fire roasted diced green chiles, drained
- 2 cans (14.5 oz) "salsa style" fire roasted diced tomatoes, undrained
- 2 cups water
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 medium red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 medium orange or yellow bell pepper, chopped
- 1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 medium onion, chopped

# Directions
Heat oil in a large deep skillet or dutch oven (dutch oven is bae). Add onion, bell peppers, and green chiles. Cook vegetables until the begin to soften, stirring occasionally.  

Stir in tomatoes, water, salsa, and Jambalaya Mix. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  

Stir in the chicken and sausage. Cover and cook 10 minutes more, until the rice is tender and most of the liquid has cooked off. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.
